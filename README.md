## 1. My Approach and Architecture of the Project

In this project, I used a modular approach to design a flexible and scalable system. The architecture focuses on clean separation of concerns in both Python and .NET. In .Net part, I've tried my best to code it up and follow the guidelines. So, if you spot something that looks a little off, please consider it a learning opportunity in 4-5 days :). 

The core idea is to handle holiday rules and the generation of holiday dates for various scenarios, such as public holidays, moveable holidays, and certain occurrence holidays.

Key features of the architecture:


### **Factory**
The Factory pattern is centralized in services such as `HolidayFactory` and its associated holiday classes. This pattern provides scalability by enabling the creation of different types of holiday instances easily. Once new types of holidays are added to the system, they can be created simply by introducing a new class. This modular approach ensures that the system remains flexible and extensible as it grows.

- **Scalability**: Adding new holiday types is straightforward by creating a new class.
- **Centralization**: The `HolidayFactory` centralizes the holiday creation logic, simplifying maintenance.

### **Validator**
The `ValideteDates` method ensures that date inputs are valid and conform to the expected format and range. It plays a critical role in maintaining data integrity by verifying that dates are correctly formatted and fall within a valid range. The `DateValidator` uses generic methods that can be applied to various functions, taking in parameters such as `startDate` and `endDate`, and validating that the date values are properly structured.

- **Validation**: Ensures that dates follow correct formats and ranges.
- **Reusability**: The methods in `ValideteDates` are generic and can be used across various functions requiring date validation.
- **Data Integrity**: Maintains the integrity of the system by preventing invalid dates from being processed.

### **DayUtils Class**

The `DayUtils` class provides utility methods for handling date manipulations, focusing on calculating the number of days between two dates, determining weekend days, calculating public holidays, and generating holiday dates within a specified period. It is ideal for use in applications where date-related calculations and date filtering are needed.


## 2. How Can I Run the Projects?

### 2.1. Python

```markdown

To run the Python project, follow these steps:

#### 1. Install Python

Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system. If you donâ€™t have Python installed, follow these steps:

- **Windows**: Download Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".
- **macOS**: Python 3 is usually pre-installed. You can verify this by running:
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```
    If it is not installed, you can install it via Homebrew:
    ```bash
    brew install python
    ```
- **Linux**: Use your package manager to install Python:
    - For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:
      ```bash
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
      ```
    - For Fedora:
      ```bash
      sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip
      ```

Once Python is installed, verify the installation by running:
```bash
python --version
```
or if `python3` is the default:
```bash
python3 --version
```

Here's the updated `README.md` file with the section on setting up the project environment and including the `requirements.txt` part:

---

### 2. Set Up the Project Environment

1. **Clone or Download the Project**: Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/design.com.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd ~/design.com/python_solution
    ```

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**: It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create and activate one using the following commands:

    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment
    python3 -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    # For macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. **Install Project Dependencies**: The required dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them by running:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


---


#### 3. Running the Python Scripts

If you want to run multiple Python scripts (e.g., task-specific scripts), you can execute them like so:

- **Run Task 1**:
    ```bash
    python3 python_solution_task1.py
    ```
- **Output Of Task 1**:

**Note**: 

- If you want to edit the date range in Task 1, you can easily change the `datetime` objects within the `start_end_date_list` list.  
- **For Example**:  
    The following:  
    ```python
    "start_date": datetime.date(2013, 10, 7),
    "end_date": datetime.date(2013, 10, 9)
    ```  
    Can be changed to:  
    ```python
    "start_date": datetime.date(2013, 1, 10),
    "end_date": datetime.date(2013, 12, 9)
    ```

- **Run Task 2**:
    ```bash
    python3 python_solution_task2.py
    ```

- **Output Of Task 2**:

**Note**: 

- If you want to edit the date range in Task 2, you can easily change the `datetime` objects within the `start_end_date_list` list.  
- **For Example**:  
    The following:  
    ```python
    {
    "start_date": datetime.date(2013, 10, 7),
    "end_date": datetime.date(2013, 10, 9)}
    ```  
    Can be changed to:  
    ```python

- If you want to add or remove public holiday in Task 2
- **For Example**:  
    The following:  
    ```python
        first_public_holiday = datetime.date(2013, 12, 25)
        public_holiday_list = [
            first_public_holiday,
            second_public_holiday,
            third_public_holiday
        ]

    ```  
    Can be changed to:  
    ```python
        new_public_holiday = datetime.date(2013, 12, 1)
        public_holiday_list = [
            first_public_holiday,

#### 4. Running the all tasks at once 

```bash
./run_all_task.sh
```


---



### 2.2. Dotnet

To run the .NET project, you can run all there tasks at once by just running Program.cs file. ( I think you know more than me :) )
Just please make sure Microsoft.Extensions.Logging file is installed incase is not built in.

## 3. How Can I Run the Unittests?

### Python Unittests
Make sure you have installed the packages, incase if you have not;

```bash
  pip install pytest
  pip install mock
  ```


```bash
  cd /design.com/python_solution
  export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
```

Run tests

```bash
  pytest test_validator.py
  pytest test_business_day_counter.py
  pytest test_task1.py
  pytest test_task2.py
  pytest test_task3.py
```


### .NET Unittests
I have not enough time to write unittest in .net, since having a limited of time. I hope that show you have knowledge about unittests by writing the unittests in python.

## 4. Code Documentation

### 4.1. Python

### **Class: `DayUtils`**
The main utility class for date calculations.

#### **Methods**

1. **`days_count_between_dates(start_date, end_date)`**

   - **Parameters**:
     - `start_date` (`date`): The starting date.
     - `end_date` (`date`): The ending date.
   - **Returns**:
     - `int`: The number of full days.
   - **Precondition**:
     - Dates are validated using `@validate_dates`.

2. **`remainder(total_days)`**
   - Calculates the remainder of days when dividing the total number of days by `7`.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `total_days` (`int`): Total days between two dates.
   - **Returns**:
     - `int`: Remainder days.

3. **`quotient(total_days)`**
   - Calculates the number of full weeks in the total days between two dates.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `total_days` (`int`): Total days between two dates.
   - **Returns**:
     - `int`: Number of full weeks.

4. **`total_weekend_days_count(start_date, total_days)`**
   - Determines the total number of weekend days (Saturdays and Sundays) in a date range.
   - **Parameters**:
